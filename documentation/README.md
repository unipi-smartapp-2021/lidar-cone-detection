# Documentation
This subdirectory hosts the documentation files for both sub-groups of sensory:
- ```Sensory_Recognition_documentation.pdf``` explains how the object detection was done for both stereocamera and lidar (take a look at the ```src``` directory).
- ```Sensory_ROS_documentation.pdf``` deals about the sensors' implementation on the simulator (what you can find in the ```sensory``` directory).
